Although it would have been possible to manually wire the Raspberry Pi directly to the LED matrix, I decided to invest in the Matrix Bonnet for several reasons. For just a few euros, the bonnet offered a much safer, more reliable, and easier solution compared to manual wiring. It not only simplifies the connection process but also reduces the risk of damaging the components due to incorrect wiring. The Matrix Bonnet is specifically designed for use with Raspberry Pi boards, allowing for seamless integration and a cleaner, more stable setup. It handles all the necessary data and power connections without the hassle of complex wiring, which saved me significant time and effort during development. The bonnet is just one of the many incredible products developed by Adafruit Industries, which are designed to make open-source DIY projects like this not only accessible but also well-documented and enjoyable\footnote{\url{https://www.adafruit.com}}.
