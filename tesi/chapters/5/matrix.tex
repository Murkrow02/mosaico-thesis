When it came to selecting the LED matrix, I was faced with a wide array of options, each offering different resolutions, sizes, brands, and even color configurations. The first decision I had to make was regarding the resolution, which would directly impact the amount of information the display could render. The two primary options I considered were a rectangular 64x32 matrix or a square 64x64 matrix. After careful consideration, I ultimately chose the 64x64 matrix. This resolution struck the perfect balance for my needs: it wasn't too large, which kept the overall system compact and cost-effective, yet it provided enough screen real estate to display a substantial amount of information, ensuring that the display would be both functional and visually appealing.
