The growing demand for interconnected devices capable of communication in constrained environments has fueled the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT). As a tech enthusiast, I was naturally drawn to this world when I moved into my own home, where I sought to make every electronic device “smart” futhermore, I have always enjoyed having control centralized in a single place, like a dashboard—somewhere I can display dynamic information for everything I want to monitor.

Nevertheless, building a real-time content display system in an IoT environment presents several challenges, such as constrained bandwidth and low computational power. This thesis focuses on overcoming these obstacles by developing an IoT-based display system that leverages CoAP and BLE to efficiently deliver real-time dynamic content to an LED matrix driven by a Raspberry Pi.
