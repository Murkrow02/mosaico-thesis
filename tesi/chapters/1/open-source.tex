The Mosaico project has been developed and released under the AGPL-3.0 license, a copyleft open-source license designed to ensure that modifications and derivative works are freely available to the community. The full project code, including the various components of the platform, is publicly accessible for review, modification, and redistribution. The project's source code is organized and hosted on GitHub and can be found at the following \footnote{\url{https://github.com/orgs/mosaico-matrix}}. Additionally, a separate organization dedicated to the collection and publication of community-created widgets is available \footnote{\url{https://github.com/orgs/mosaico-widgets/}}.

Open-source software plays a pivotal role in advancing technological innovation and promoting collaborative development. By adopting an open-source model, Mosaico not only enables users to benefit from the transparency and adaptability of the software but also fosters an ecosystem where developers and hobbyists alike can contribute enhancements, fix bugs, and create new functionalities that serve the needs of the broader community. This collective effort accelerates the development process, often yielding more secure, stable, and feature-rich software than proprietary alternatives.

Furthermore, the Mosaico ecosystem is designed to embrace these open-source values not only in the core platform but also in the development and sharing of widgets. 

By leveraging the open-source model, Mosaico aspires to build a self-sustaining, innovative community that thrives on shared knowledge and collective growth.
