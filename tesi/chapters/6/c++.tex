I began by creating a minimal prototype capable of turning individual pixels on and off on the matrix. Fortunately, there was an excellent project on GitHub by Hzeller \footnote{\url{https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix}} that offered a solid C++ implementation, covering the fundamental functionality I needed to get started, including: \begin{itemize} \item Direct manipulation of individual pixel colors \item Filling the entire matrix with color \item Creating an in-memory canvas to draw on while displaying something else on the matrix, allowing for smooth transitions when swapping \item Loading .bdf fonts and converting text to pixels \end{itemize}

Given the goal of providing modularity, it made sense to define a class that each Widget could inherit from, allowing them to implement their own methods. 
Each widget is designed to encapsulate its internal workings, exposing only a single method: \textit{renderNextFrame}. Similar to a sprite in a game engine, the widget’s responsibility is simply to determine where to paint pixels in the next frame—no more, no less. Here’s an example of a widget that draws a simple rectangle:

\begin{minted}{c++}
class RectangleWidget : public Widget
{
    int width, height, x, y;
    Color color;
    RectangleWidget(int width, int height, int x, int y, Color color)
    {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.color = color;
    }

    void renderNextFrame(Canvas *canvas)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < width; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < height; j++) {
                canvas->SetPixel(x+i, y+j, color.r, color.g, color.b);
            }
        }
    }
}
\end{minted}
\newpage
At this point my application is very simple but working and it looks something like this:

\begin{minted}{c++}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    Logger::logInfo("Mosaico is starting");

    // Init matrix
    RGBMatrix::Options matrix_options;
    matrix_options.rows = 64;
    matrix_options.cols = 64;
    // Other config stuff

    // Create matrix object
    RGBMatrix *matrix = RGBMatrix::CreateFromOptions(matrix_options);

    // Create a widget
    Widget runningWidget = new RectangleWidget(w,h,x,y,color);

    // Main loop
    while (true) {
        matrix->clear();
        runningWidget->renderNextFrame(matrix);
        // delay here to ensure 30Hz refresh rate
    }
}
\end{minted}
\subsection{The Canvas} As you may have noticed, the \textit{renderNextFrame} method accepts a \textit{Canvas} object as a parameter instead of directly manipulating the matrix. This approach aligns with one of the SOLID principles: \textbf{dependency inversion} \cite{dep_inv_principle}. The widgets do not need to know the specifics of the matrix; they interact with it as if it were a simple canvas to paint on. This abstraction not only simplifies the widget code but also allowed for greater flexibility as the project evolved.

\subsection{Drawables}
\label{widget_canvas_abstraction}
As I continued developing widgets, I found myself repeatedly writing similar code, particularly for drawing shapes and text. This repetition led to the creation of the \textbf{Drawable} concept—a base class that allowed me to store common shapes and figures as objects. This abstraction made it easier to create and manipulate these elements consistently across different widgets.

The \textit{Drawable} class encapsulates shared functionality such as position, color, and animation, providing a unified interface for handling visual elements. Here's a simplified structure of the \textit{Drawable} class hierarchy:

\begin{center}
  \makebox[\textwidth]{
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\paperwidth]{tesi/img/drawables.png}}
\end{center}

\newpage

At this point I had to edit the \textit{Widget} class in order to correctly register and render drawables.


\begin{minted}{c++}

class Widget {
private:
     // Drawables to be rendered
    std::vector<Drawable*> registeredDrawables;    
public:
    /// Add a new drawable to the widget drawable list
    void registerDrawable(Drawable* drawable);
    /// Remove a drawable from the widget drawable list
    void unregisterDrawable(Drawable* drawable);
    /// Clear all drawables
    void clearDrawables();

    void renderNextFrame(Canvas* canvas) {
        // Call the inheriting widgets to do their job
        render(canvas);
        // Drawables should be now updated, draw them
        for (Drawable* drawable : registeredDrawables) {
            drawable->draw(canvas);
        }
    }
protected:
    Widget();
    /// Pure virtual method to be overridden inheriting widgets for rendering
    virtual void render(Canvas* canvas) = 0;
};
\end{minted}

This basic setup was enough to get things up and running, enabling me to create more complex widgets.

\subsection{Loading Widgets at Runtime} At this stage, I had a straightforward method for creating new widgets and drawing shapes efficiently. If someone wanted to contribute to the project and add a new widget, they would clone the project, create a new C++ class that inherits from \textit{Widget}, write the necessary code, compile the app again, and submit a pull request.

While this approach would work, it lacked flexibility. Every time a developer added a new widget, users would need to update their software to access it. This wasn't ideal for a modular and dynamic system.

In a meeting with my supervisor, we explored the idea of treating widgets like "plug-ins" or encoded strings that the C++ program could decode in real time to display dynamic content. Although this concept was easier said than done, the potential excited me, and I immediately began experimenting with different approaches to find the best solution.

\subsubsection{Custom Encoding} My first thought was to create a custom encoding format for widgets, something akin to JSON or YAML but optimized for my needs. I imagined a frame-based system where I could specify what to render at each frame, perhaps even introducing a simple mock language to handle loops and conditionals. However, this approach proved too limiting and complex, especially for achieving the flexibility I desired. It was soon discarded.

\subsubsection{Lua vs. ChaiScript} I quickly realized that the only way to provide developers with the maximum flexibility for widget creation was to embed a Turing-complete scripting language. Drawing from my limited knowledge of game development, I knew that popular games often use Lua for custom levels and dynamic content creation \footnote{\url{https://create.roblox.com/docs/scripting}}.

Lua, being lightweight and having a C-based interpreter, seemed like a good candidate. I embedded Lua into my application, allowing it to interface with my C++ code. Initially, this appeared to be the solution, but several issues arose:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Integration complexity: Mapping complex C++ types such as drawables, the canvas, and various helper functions to Lua proved cumbersome and overcomplicated.
        \item Syntax dissatisfaction: I found Lua's syntax unintuitive and less modern than I wanted for widget development. I aimed for a scripting language that would feel clean, readable, and enjoyable to write.
    \end{itemize}

After further research, I discovered ChaiScript \footnote{\url{https://chaiscript.com/}}, a lightweight, JavaScript-like embedded scripting language designed specifically for C++. Its integration was much simpler than Lua, with easier mapping of types and classes. I liked how the implementation was progressing, and I finally got a working solution. Below is a demo of the first widget written in ChaiScript, where I comment out parts of the code in real-time, and they are rendered immediately on the matrix!

\begin{figure}[h] \centering \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth} \centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tesi/img/chai_demo/1.png} \caption*{Creation of a Text drawable} \end{minipage} \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth} \centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tesi/img/chai_demo/2.png} \caption*{Creation of 4 rectangles} \end{minipage} \end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h] \centering \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth} \centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tesi/img/chai_demo/3.png} \caption*{Set text in random colors in the loop() function} \end{minipage} \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth} \centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tesi/img/chai_demo/4.png} \caption*{Animate everything to fade away} \end{minipage} \end{figure}

This solution allowed the engine to interpret and render widgets in real-time, with no recompilation required—an exciting milestone!

\subsubsection{ChaiScript Limitations} While ChaiScript was a solid fit, I eventually realized its limitations:


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Language popularity}: The language is mostly straightforward and easy to use but is far from being popular. In fact, there are few resources online to learn how to use it, and it's not frequently updated.
    \item \textbf{Language modularity}: Chaiscript has no standard modules. While the community has created a few for tasks such as math functions and JSON deserialization, any additional functionality like a REST client or file management requires wrapping C++ libraries manually.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Discovering Pybind11 and Python Integration} After further research, I discovered Pybind11 \cite{pybind11}, a library that enables seamless embedding of the Python interpreter within C++ code. Despite my initial reservations about Python, its vast modularity—achieved through pip packages—and its popularity made it an attractive alternative to ChaiScript.

With Pybind11, mapping C++ classes to Python objects is nearly effortless, requiring only minimal class declarations. This allowed me to tap into Python's full power while maintaining the performance and flexibility of my C++ engine.


\begin{minted}{c++}
PYBIND11_EMBEDDED_MODULE(mosaico, m) {

    // Bind color class
    py::class_<Color>(m, "Color")
    .def(py::init<int, int, int>());

    // Binding the MatrixWidget class
    py::class_<MatrixWidget>(m, "MatrixWidget")
            .def("createRectangle", &MatrixWidget::createRectangle)
            .def("createImage", &MatrixWidget::createPPM)
            .def("createText", &MatrixWidget::createText)
            .def("createCanvas", &MatrixWidget::createCanvas)
            .def("remove", &MatrixWidget::unregisterDrawable)
            .def("setPixel", &MatrixWidget::setPixel)
            .def("clear", &MatrixWidget::clearDrawables);

    // Bind the Drawable class
    py::class_<Drawable>(m, "Drawable")
    .def("moveTo", &Drawable::moveTo)
    .def("translateBy", &Drawable::translateBy)
    .def("translateXBy", &Drawable::translateXBy)
    // a lot of other stuff
}
\end{minted}

\newpage

The last thing to do is to create a \textit{DynamicWidget} class that will inherit from \textit{Widget} and will invoke the python script to get a new canvas each frame or to register drawables:

\begin{minted}{c++}

class DynamicWidget : public MatrixWidget {
public:
    DynamicWidget(std::string widgetPath, std::string configurationPath){
        // Get files from path and parse metadata
        if (!initializePaths() || !readMetadata()) {
            validWidget = false;
            Logger::logError("Widget initialization failed");
        } else {
            validWidget = true;
            Logger::logDebug("Widget loaded successfully");
        }
        // Register C++ -> Python bindings
        bindObjectsToPython();
        // Load the widget script and execute everything except the loop function
        py::exec(widgetScriptString);
    }
        void renderNextFrame(Canvas* canvas) override {
        try {
            // Execute the loop function
            py::exec("loop()");
        } catch (const py::error_already_set &e) {
            Logger::logError("Error while executing loop function: " + std::string(e.what()));
            validWidget = false;
            canvas->Fill(RED_COLOR);
        }
    }
}
\end{minted}

\newpage

\subsection{Canvas buffer}
The prototype now seems quite ready but there is a single problem left: every widget, even if as far as it is concerned is writing on a \textit{Canvas}, it is still using the real matrix under the hood to render pixels, this can cause problems for scenarios like this:

\begin{minted}{c++}
// Main loop
while (true) {
    matrix->clear();
    // Matrix is full black here
    veryComplexWidget->renderNextFrame(matrix); // will write pixel by pixel
    // Content is now displayed
}
\end{minted}

It is obvious that writing single pixels directly on a matrix is a problem for widgets that requires a bit of computation between pixel and pixel and will result in image flickering.
Luckily the library I used provided me two useful methods:

\begin{minted}{c++}
  // Create a new buffer to be used for multi-buffering. The returned new
  // Buffer implements a Canvas with the same size of thie RGBMatrix.
  // You can use it to draw off-screen on it, then swap it with the active
  // buffer using SwapOnVSync(). That would be classic double-buffering.
  //
  // You can also create as many FrameCanvas as you like and for instance use
  // them to pre-fill scenes of an animation for fast playback later.
  FrameCanvas *CreateFrameCanvas();

  // This method waits to the next VSync and swaps the active buffer with the
  // supplied buffer. The formerly active buffer is returned.
  FrameCanvas *SwapOnVSync(FrameCanvas *other, unsigned framerate_fraction = 1);
\end{minted}

By incorporating these methods into the code, I effectively resolved the flickering issue. This approach enabled smooth rendering by leveraging double-buffering, ensuring that complex widgets could perform the necessary computations without directly writing pixels to the matrix, thus eliminating visual artifacts.

\newpage

I then decided to separate a bit of concerns and I started working on a \textit{CanvasBuffer} class. Since my intent was not to write on the real matrix anymore but to create a set of canvas to swap on the matrix at some point in time, I also seized the occasion to make these canvases even more generic by giving them the possibility to be of arbitrary sizes, they still needed to be smaller than the hardware matrix itself but they could occupy for example the bottom half of the screen, the top left quarter etc. I called this class \textit{CanvasLayer} and it looks like this:

\begin{minted}{c++}
/// A CanvasLayer is a layer that can be painted on by a widget.
/// Allows to create composite widgets to be displayed on the matrix.
/// Can be narrower or shorter than the matrix.
class CanvasLayer : public Canvas {

private:

    // Pixels are stored in a list to allow for 
    // easy iteration and manipulation
    std::list<Pixel> pixels;

public:

    CanvasLayerPosition pos;
    CanvasLayer(CanvasLayerPosition position = CanvasLayerPosition::FULL);
    ~CanvasLayer();

    // Will actually write pixels on another canvas (even the matrix)
    void paintOntoCanvas(Canvas *canvas, int xOff = 0, int yOff = 0);
    int width() const;
    int height() const;
    void Fill(Color color);
    void SetPixel(int x, int y, Color color);
    void Clear();
    CanvasLayer *Clone();
    void setBorder(Color color);
    void setPadding(int padding);
    int getPixelCount();
};
\end{minted}

\newpage

As you may notice, the \textit{CanvasLayer} class simply implements the \textit{Canvas} interface. The principle of dependency inversion mentioned before \ref{widget_canvas_abstraction} allowed me to do this upgrade while being completely transparent to objects that worked with a \textit{Canvas}.

This is what the \textit{CanvasBuffer} class looked like:


\begin{minted}{c++}

/// This class is responsible for buffering the canvas frames
/// This is useful when you want to render multiple widgets on the matrix and be able to show them all at once
/// The buffer will be able to swap the frames on the matrix without flickering
class CanvasBuffer {

private:
    MatrixDevice *matrix;
    std::list<Canvas*> buffer;

public:
    CanvasBuffer(MatrixDevice *matrix, int bufferSize) {
        this->matrix = matrix;
        for (int i = 0; i < bufferSize; i++) {
            buffer.push_back(matrix->CreateFrameCanvas());
        }
    }
    // This can be called multiple time for the current frame
    // Is basically used to compose the final composite frame
    // to later swap on the matrix using loadNextFrameOnMatrix()
    void paintPartialLayerOnCurrentFrame(CanvasLayer *canvasLayer) {
        auto *currentFrame = buffer.front();
        canvasLayer->paintOntoCanvas(currentFrame);
    }
    // Uses the frame crafted with the method above to swap it on actual matrix
    void loadNextFrameOnMatrix() {
        // Swap current frame on matrix
        auto *currentFrame = buffer.front();
        buffer.pop_front(); 
        matrix->SwapFrameCanvas(currentFrame); 
        buffer.push_back(currentFrame); 
        // Prepare next frame
        auto *nextFrame = buffer.front();
        nextFrame->Clear();
    }
};
\end{minted}

This is the high-level view of the whole final rendering software:
