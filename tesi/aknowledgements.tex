This project would not have been possible without the incredible contributions from the open-source community. A special thanks goes to Henner Zeller for his brilliant C++ library to control the LED matrix\footnote{\url{https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix}} and to Adafruit for their LED matrix bonnet and setup guide\footnote{\url{https://learn.adafruit.com/}}. The Nlohmann JSON library\footnote{\url{https://github.com/nlohmann/json}}, pybind11\footnote{\url{https://github.com/pybind/pybind11}}, aiocoap\footnote{\url{https://github.com/chrysn/aiocoap}}, and bless\footnote{\url{https://github.com/kevincar/bless}} libraries provided seamless integration between Python and C++, ensuring robust communication between modules. Tools such as GitPython\footnote{\url{https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython}} and Docker\footnote{\url{https://www.docker.com/}} significantly streamlined the development and deployment processes.

A huge thank you also goes to JetBrains for their educational licenses of IDEs like PHPStorm\footnote{\url{https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/}}, CLion\footnote{\url{https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/}}, and PyCharm\footnote{\url{https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/}}, which greatly facilitated the development across different project components.

Lastly, while ChatGPT\footnote{\url{https://chat.openai.com/}} proved invaluable in mastering Flutter and Python and speeding up development processes, it was used as a learning aid rather than a coding substitute, reinforcing concepts and helping resolve challenges faster without replacing the core development effort.
